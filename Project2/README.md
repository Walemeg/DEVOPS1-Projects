# GIT PROJECT

## Introduction
Git is a version control system (VCS) that solves the problem of sharing code efficiently and keeping track of chnages made to source code. It's a distributed form of VCS which is an improvement on the centralised VCS e.g SVN.

The project below demonstates various actions invlved while working with Git

### 1) Initialising Git

Before I initialised git , I have git first installed on my system and have an existing working directly called Git_Practice. I also ensured I registered my identity (name and email) and branch on Git terminal as shwon below.

After configuring my identity in Git, I moved to the working folder using "cd" command , then initialised Git as shown below.

### 2) Making My First Commit

To commit simply means to save changes made inside the git folder. Changes could be adding , modifying or deleteing files or comment.
In the example below, I use the touch command to create an additional file into my working directory (to an existing file called walemeglinux.txt) called linux2.doc and added it to Git.
See output below

The created file was commited or saved in .git folder using the command "git commit -m "First update to Commiting all files to repository"
 See output below
